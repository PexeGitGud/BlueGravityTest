General Comments:
    I believe all my thought process is well explained by checking all the GitHub Summaries and comments, except for the things I didn’t do or expected to have gone differently.
    One of those things is the lack of ability to create the art of the game in time, not that I’m a bad artist, just that I’m not a fast artist, since this is not my focus. I really struggled to find or use what was already on the project, but I believe it all turned out to be pretty good.
    Another thing that really got me was trying to solve some sprite animation issues regarding the base character and the outfits, since I thought it was possible to use just one Animator for everything, but I had to use one for each since there was a need to use different Sprite Renderers one on top of another.
    To finalize my test I would like to say I loved working with this short project. I actually had more plans for it, like adding a Gold Change VFX on top of the traders to show when they gained or lost gold and the amount of it. I would also love to add the rest of the outfits, hats and hairs that were on the project, but I ended up not having enough time for them, even though I had already made the code, I’m still missing the animation for them.
